TODO: Enter the cookbook description here.


Created 2 environments - Staging & Production using 'knife environment' command. 
Then using environment, Apache 2.2.29 is installed on Staging and 2.2.20 on Production using different cookbook versions.

Cookbook versions can be modified by changing the version in metadata file and then uploading it to the chef server.
